<h1>Module <code>ljepsen.client</code></h1>
<p>Module with default Jepsen client.</p>
<p>


<h3>Clients</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>append</strong> checks for dependency cycles in append/read transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>bank</strong> concurrent transfers between rows of a shared table.</li>
    <li><strong>bank-multitable</strong> multi-table variant of the bank test.</li>
    <li><strong>long-fork</strong> distinguishes between parallel snapshot isolation and standard SI.</li>
    <li><strong>monotonic</strong> looks for contradictory orders over increment-only registers.</li>
    <li><strong>register</strong> concurrent atomic updates to a shared register.</li>
    <li><strong>sequential</strong> looks for serializable yet non-sequential orders on

    <li><strong>set</strong> concurrent unique appends to a single table.</li>

    <li><strong>table</strong> checks for a race condition in table creation.</li>
    <li><strong>txn-cycle</strong> looks for write-read dependency cycles over read-write
    registers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monotonic</h3>

<p> Monotonic: a counter which increments over time.</p>

<p> Claim: successive reads of that value by any single client should
 observe monotonically increasing transaction timestamps and values.
 Required for: monotonicity.</p>

<p> Verifies that clients observe monotonic state and timestamps when
 performing current reads, and that reads of past timestamps observe
 monotonic state.</p>

<p> The monotonic tests verify that transaction timestamps are consistent
 with logical transaction order. In a transaction, we find the maximum
 value in a table, select the transaction timestamp, and then insert a
 row with a value one greater than the maximum, along with the current
 timestamp, the node, process, and table numbers. When sorted by
 timestamp, we expect that the values inserted should monotonically
 increase, so long as transaction timestamps are consistent with the
 database's effective serialization order.</p>

<p> For our monotonic state, we'll use a register, implemented as an
 instance with a single value. That register will be incremented by <code>inc</code>
 calls, starting at 0.</p>


<pre>
{:<span class="global">type</span> :invoke, :f :inc, :value <span class="keyword">nil</span>}
</pre>

<p> which returns</p>


<pre>
{:<span class="global">type</span> :invoke, :f inc, :value [ts, v]}
</pre>

<p> Meaning that we set the value to v at time ts. Meanwhile, we'll execute
 reads like:</p>


<pre>
{:<span class="global">type</span> :invoke, :f :read, :value [ts, <span class="keyword">nil</span>]}
</pre>

<p> which means we should read the register at time <code>ts</code>, returning</p>


<pre>
{:<span class="global">type</span> :ok, :f :read, :value [ts, v]}.
</pre>

<p> If the timestamp is nil, we read at the current time, and return the
 timestamp we executed at.</p>

<h3>Multimonotonic</h3>

<p> <!--
 https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/7f3d0b1ca20b27681f3af10124a8b2d2d98c8e18/tidb/src/tidb/monotonic.clj#L37-L87
 https://github.com/fauna/jepsen/blob/b5c3b20d27166ca87796b48077ac17feec2937f9/src/jepsen/faunadb/monotonic.clj
 --></p>

<p> Similar to the monotonic test, this test takes an increment-only
 register and looks for cases where reads flow backwards. Unlike the
 monotonic test, we try to maximize performance (and our chances to
 observe nonmonotonicity) by sacrificing some generality: all updates to
 a given register happen in a single worker, and are performed as blind
 writes to avoid triggering OCC read locks which lower throughput.</p>

<h3>Sequential</h3>

<p> Sequential: in one process, perform two write transactions (<code>write_1</code> then
 <code>write_2</code>), concurrently read in the reverse order.</p>

<p> Claim: no instances where <code>write_2</code> is present before <code>write_1</code> should be
 discovered. Required for: sequential Consistency.</p>

<p> To do this, we establish a set of registers, each comprised of a key and
 a value. On each register separately, we perform a series of increment
 operations, mixed with reads of that register. Since our transactions
 only interact with single keys, snapshot isolation implies
 serializability. Since the value of a register can only increase over
 time, we expect that for any given process, and for any given register
 read by that process, the value of that register should monotonically
 increase.</p>

<p> Sequential consistency requires that the orders of operations observed by
 each individual client be consistent with one another. We evaluate
 sequential consistency by having one process perform two transactions, each
 inserting a different key, and, concurrently, reading those keys in the
 reverse order using a second process:</p>


<pre>
T1: w(x, <span class="number">1</span>)
T2: w(y, <span class="number">1</span>)
T3: r(y)
T4: r(x)
</pre>

<p> A serializable system could allow x and y to be inserted in either order,
 and likewise, could evaluate the reads at any point in time: reads could see
 neither, only x, only y, or both. A sequentially consistent system, however,
 can never observe y alone, since the same process inserted x prior to y.</p>

<h3>Bank</h3>

<p> Test simulates a set of bank accounts, one per row, and transfers money
 between them at random, ensuring that no account goes negative. Under
 snapshot isolation, one can prove that transfers must serialize, and the
 sum of all accounts is conserved. Meanwhile, read transactions select
 the current balance of all accounts. Snapshot isolation ensures those
 reads see a consistent snapshot, which implies the sum of accounts in
 any read is constant as well.</p>

<p> The bank test stresses several invariants provided by snapshot
 isolation. We construct a set of bank accounts, each with three
 attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>type</em>, which is always "account". We use this to query for all
    accounts.</li>
    <li><em>key</em>, an integer which identifies that account.</li>
    <li><em>amount</em>, the amount of money in that account.</li>
</ul>

<p> Our test begins with a fixed amount ($100) of money in a single account,
 and proceeds to randomly transfer money between accounts. Transfers
 proceed by reading two random accounts by key, and writing back new
 amounts for those accounts to reflect some money moving between them.
 Concurrently, clients read all accounts to observe the total state of
 the system.</p>

<p> Bank: simulated bank accounts including transfers between accounts
 (using transactions).</p>

<p> Claim: the total of all accounts should be consistent. Required for:
 snapshot isolation.</p>

<h3>Long fork</h3>

<p> Long Fork: non-intersecting transactions are run concurrently.</p>

<p> Claim: transactions happen in some specific order for future reads.
 Prohibited in: snapshot isolation (Prefix property). Allowed in:
 parallel snapshot isolation.</p>

<p> For performance reasons, some database systems implement parallel
 snapshot isolation, rather than standard snapshot isolation. Parallel
 snapshot isolation allows an anomaly prevented by standard SI: a long
 fork, in which non-conflicting write transactions may be visible in
 incompatible orders. As an example, consider four transactions over an
 empty initial state:</p>


<pre>
(write x <span class="number">1</span>)
(write y <span class="number">1</span>)
(read x <span class="keyword">nil</span>) (read y <span class="number">1</span>)
(read x <span class="number">1</span>) (read y <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
</pre>

<p> Here, we insert two records, x and y. In a serializable system, one
 record should have been inserted before the other. However, transaction
 3 observes y inserted before x, and transaction 4 observes x inserted
 before y. These observations are incompatible with a total order of
 inserts.</p>

<p> To test for this behavior, we insert a sequence of unique keys, and
 concurrently query for small batches of those keys, hoping to observe a
 pair of states in which the implicit order of insertion conflicts.</p>

<p> Long fork is an anomaly prohibited by snapshot isolation, but allowed by
 the slightly weaker model parallel snapshot isolation. In a long fork,
 updates to independent keys become visible to reads in a way that isn't
 consistent with a total order of those updates. For instance:</p>


<pre>
T1: w(x, <span class="number">1</span>)
T2: w(y, <span class="number">1</span>)
T3: r(x, <span class="number">1</span>), r(y, <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
T4: r(x, <span class="keyword">nil</span>), r(y, <span class="number">1</span>)
</pre>

<p> Under snapshot isolation, T1 and T2 may execute concurrently, because
 their write sets don't intersect. However, every transaction should
 observe a snapshot consistent with applying those writes in some order.
 Here, T3 implies T1 happened before T2, but T4 implies the opposite. We
 run an n-key generalization of these transactions continuously in our
 long fork test, and look for cases where some keys are updated out of
 order.</p>

<p> In snapshot isolated systems, reads should observe a state consistent
 with a total order of transactions. A long fork anomaly occurs when a
 pair of reads observes contradictory orders of events on distinct
 records - for instance, T1 observing record x before record y was
 created, and T2 observing y before x. In the long fork test, we insert
 unique rows into a table, and query small groups of those rows, looking
 for cases where two reads observe incompatible orders.</p>

<p> Looks for instances of long fork: a snapshot isolation violation involving
 incompatible orders of writes to disparate objects.</p>

<h3>Append</h3>

<p> The <em>append</em> test models the database as a collection of named lists,
 and performs transactions comprised of read and append operations. A
 read returns the value of a particular list, and an append adds a single
 unique element to the end of a particular list. We derive ordering
 dependencies between these transactions, and search for cycles in that
 dependency graph to identify consistency anomalies.</p>

<p> In terms of Jepsen values in operation are lists of integers. Each operation
 performs a transaction, comprised of micro-operations which are either reads of
 some value (returning the entire list) or appends (adding a single number to
 whatever the present value of the given list is). We detect cycles in these
 transactions using Jepsen's cycle-detection system.</p>

<h3>G2</h3>

<p> G2 checks for a type of phantom anomaly prevented by serializability:
 anti-dependency cycles involving predicate reads.</p>

<p> We can also test for the presence of anti-dependency cycles in pairs of
 transactions, which should be prevented under serializability. These
 cycles, termed "G2", are one of the anomalies described by Atul Adya in
 his 1999 thesis on transactional consistency. It involves a cycle in the
 transaction dependency graph, where one transaction overwrites a value a
 different transaction has read. For instance:</p>


<pre>
T1: r(x), w(y)
T2: r(y), w(x)
</pre>

<p> could interleave like so:</p>


<pre>
T1: r(x)
T2: r(y)
T1: w(y)
T2: w(x)
T1: commit
T2: commit
</pre>

<p> This violates serializability because the value of a key could have
 changed since the transaction first read it. However, G2 doesn't just
 apply to individual keys - it covers predicates as well. For example, we
 can take two tables...</p>


<pre>
CREATE TABLE a (
  id    INT PRIMARY KEY,
  key   INT,
  value INT);
CREATE TABLE b (
  id    INT PRIMARY KEY,
  key   INT,
  value INT);
</pre>

<p> where <code>id</code> is a globally unique identifier, and key denotes a particular
 instance of a test. Our transactions select all rows for a specific key, in
 either table, matching some predicate:</p>


<pre>
SELECT * FROM a WHERE
  key = <span class="number">5</span> AND value % <span class="number">3</span> = <span class="number">0</span>;
SELECT * FROM b WHERE
  key = <span class="number">5</span> AND value % <span class="number">3</span> = <span class="number">0</span>;
</pre>

<p> If we find any rows matching these queries, we abort. If there are no
 matching rows, we insert (in one transaction, to a, in the other, to b),
 a row which would fall under that predicate:</p>


<pre>
INSERT INTO a VALUES (<span class="number">123</span>, <span class="number">5</span>, <span class="number">30</span>);
</pre>

<p> In a serializable history, these transactions must appear to execute
 sequentially, which implies that one sees the other's insert. Therefore,
 at most one of these transactions may succeed. Indeed, this seems to
 hold: we have never observed a case in which both of these transactions
 committed successfully. However, a closely related test, monotonic, does
 reveal a serializability violation - we'll talk about that shortly.</p>

<h3>Register</h3>

<p> Register: read, writes, and compare-and-swap operations on registers.</p>

<p> Claim: the operations should be linearizable (according to Knossos).
 Required for: snapshot isolation.</p>

<h3>Set</h3>

<p> Set: unique integers inserted as rows in a table.</p>

<p> Claim: concurrent reads should include all present values at any given
 time and at any later time. Note: a stricter variant requires immediate
 visibility instead of allowing stale reads.</p>

    Function that returns a default client implementation.
 Jepsen client must implement following methods:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>open</strong> - function that open a connection to a database instance</li>
    <li><strong>setup</strong> - function that set up a database instance</li>
    <li><strong>invoke</strong> - function that accept an operation and invoke it on database instance</li>
    <li><strong>teardown</strong> - function that tear down a database instance</li>
    <li><strong>close</strong> - function that close connection to a database instance</li>
</ul>

<p> Default implementation of a client defines open, setup, teardown and close
 methods with empty implementation that always returns true.
